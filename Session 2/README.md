**README**

- The first block of code (EVA_Session2.ipynb) )contains the block  of code unchanged, but with comments and ideally saying what the network of code stands for, plus the ideologies to improve the accuracy by a large extent (over by 80% increase in accuracy.)
-  The 2nd ( ) however is the modified code, removing all the unnecessary high kernel parameters as well as changing the end relu activation before the last 1x1x10 layer, so as to include more negative values before the softmax to improve the accuracy.
